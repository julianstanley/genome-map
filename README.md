# Gene Map

A collection of tools for exploratory analysis of personal whole genome sequence data.

If you have your "VCF" file format containing one line per identified variant in your genome, you can use this collection to explore hypotheses about the impact of these variations in molecular/biochemical pathways.

NOTE OF CAUTION: Data dredging can be dangerous, especially for this case, because you might convince yourself that you have some actionable intelligence after doing this exploration. You should not consider any hypotheses generated by your exploration as statisically supported by the data. Please be a skeptic and assume that it is most likely that any hypothesis you generate here will _not_ turn out to be correct.
